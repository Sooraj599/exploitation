# exploitation
Scenario
Being able to develop/code your own tools is a great skill to have as a penetration tester. This skill will allow you to be flexible in case one of the commonly used tools malfunctions. It will also help you understand an attack's underpinnings.

The IT Security Manager of the company you work for tasked you with creating two C++-based information stealers to sharpen your C++ skills.

Goals
Develop a simple remote information stealer

Develop a simple keylogger that sends any logged keystrokes back to the penetration tester

What you will learn
Basic C++ functionalities on Windows

Sending data over TCP using C++

Recommended tools
RDP (mstsc on Windows or rdesktop on kali)

Netcat

Tasks
Task 1: Create a simple program that steals user's directory content
Using C++, write a program that checks what files and directories are stored in the target's directory, and also sends their name back to the penetration tester.

Connect to the virtual environment using the openvpn file supplied. Once connected to the VPN, use RDP to connect to a machine where you can develop the required program. Below are the RDP connection details.

Task 2: Create a simple keylogger that sends any collected information back to the penetration tester
Using C++, write a program that runs invisibly, collects the user's keystrokes and sends them back via a network to an address of choice.

Connect to the virtual environment using the openvpn file supplied. Once connected to the VPN, use RDP to connect to a machine where you can develop the required program. Below are the RDP connection details.
